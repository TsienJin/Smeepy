Simple, Lightweight, Platform that provides APIs & Software as a service for individual developers, small teams, and small businesses.

## Motivation of Smeepy

The purpose of Smeepy is twofold.
1. a Saas that provides basic infrastructural functionality for small scale projects or businesses who want to minimise time to prototype (along with other small business tools).
2. a long term project to develop skills and knowledge in systems architecture and fullstack development.

As the sole developer behind Smeepy, I want Smeepy to be a collection of tools that I would use for future projects (and hackathons).
While being an avenue to hone my skills and knowledge in this field. Having a long term project will allow me to experiment with 
different technologies in developing an ecosystem of tools, while developing SWE "good practices" -- improving as I go along.
